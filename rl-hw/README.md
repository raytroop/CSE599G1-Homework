# Reinforcement Learning Homework #

Complete the included `.ipynb`. You can run it on colab but it should also be runnable from your local machine. We won't need any GPU hardware for this assignment. If you run it on colab, the first cell will install the required packages, otherwise you'll have to install them manually. Assignment written by Felix Leeb.
